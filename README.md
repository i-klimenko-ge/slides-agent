# Slides Agent

This project provides an experimental agent that can control slide presentations using [LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph) and custom tools.
It exposes both a command line interface and a simple FastAPI service.

## Repository layout

- `main.py` – interactive CLI for talking to the agent.
- `graph.py` – defines the LangGraph workflow connecting planning and tool execution nodes.
- `nodes.py` – node implementations that plan actions and invoke tools.
- `tools.py` – LangChain tools for listing presentations and navigating slides.
- `presentation.py` – abstractions for PPTX and PDF presentations.
- `viewer.py` – OS-specific helpers to open presentations and control them via keyboard automation.
- `service.py` – FastAPI application exposing slide control endpoints and an agent runner.
- `run_agent_client.py` – small client for sending text to the service.
- `rag.py` / `rag_module.py` – optional retrieval components used for semantic search.
- `config.py` and `config.yaml.example` – load optional configuration like the presentations directory.

`graph.jpg` visualizes the workflow defined in `graph.py` and can be regenerated by running `python graph.py`.

## Running the agent

1. (Optional) copy `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml` and adjust paths.
2. Ensure the required dependencies are installed (LangChain, LangGraph, FastAPI and viewer utilities).
3. Start the CLI: `python main.py` or run the API service: `python service.py` and interact with `run_agent_client.py`.

These notes are intended to make the project structure easier to understand when exploring the code base.
